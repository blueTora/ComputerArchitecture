## Set of Computer Architecture Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a collection of Computer Architecture projects implemented in **VHDL** using **ModelSim** software. These projects delve into various aspects of digital design, ranging from basic circuits to complex computational units.

### 1. Basic Circuits:
   - **And-Or:** Implements the logical AND and OR operations.
   - **Comparator:** Compares two binary numbers and produces appropriate outputs.
   - **Decoder:** Converts binary input into a specific output line.
   - **Encoder:** Converts multiple input lines into a single binary output.
   - **Mux:** Implements a multiplexer to select one of many inputs.

### 2. Delay In Digital Circuits:
   - **Rotation:** Demonstrates rotation operations in digital circuits.
   - **Shift - Arithmetic shift:** Performs arithmetic shift operations.
   - **Shift:** Illustrates shift operations in digital circuits.

### 3. Divider:
   - Implements a division unit to perform division operations.

### 4. Full Adders:
   - **Adder-one-bit:** Implements a basic one-bit adder.
   - **Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA):** Utilizes carry lookahead logic to enhance adder performance.
   - **Carry Select Adder (CSA):** Implements a carry-select adder for efficient addition.
   - **Ripple Cascaded Adder (RCA):** Demonstrates the traditional ripple carry adder design.

### 5. Implementation Of Sequential Circuits:
   - **DFF:** Implements D flip-flop.
   - **Mealy - 1101:** Constructs a Mealy state machine for generating the specified sequence.
